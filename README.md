SAGE UI for Android tablets is an application developped as a student's project by Jaromir Kala and Peter Novak. 
The project was supervised by Vit Rusnak.
[SAGE](http://sage.sagecommons.org) is a middleware for tiled-display visualization systems. The goal of this project was to implement an application for Android tablet which provides the same user interface as the original SAGE UI (provided within the SAGE installation). In addition, the application allows zooming of the grid overview and thus precise window positioning.

The project was realized in 2012.
